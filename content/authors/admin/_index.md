Hello! My name is Yidan Huyan. While I working on my first lab projects, first design and using the statistical methods, I was fascinated by the intricacies and application of biostatistics. The power and efficiency of computer impressed on me the importance of technology as a tool in research. As I continued to take additional electives in statistics and programming, I gradually recognized that biostatistics is indispensable in the development of pharmaceuticals and medicine because scientific questions need to be supported by quantitative research evidence. My earlier research interests in the traditional bench of life science had gradually shifted to a statistically oriented approach. After I graduated from Michigan State University, I started my Master of Public Health Studies with a concentration in Biostatistics.
