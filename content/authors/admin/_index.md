Hello! My name is Yidan Huyan. In 2015, while working on my first undergraduate lab project, aiming to find age differences and photosynthesis efficiencies in Acer trees, I was fascinated by biostatistics's intricacies. The power and efficiency of computers impressed me with the importance of technology as a research tool. As I continued to take additional electives in statistics and programming, I gradually recognized that biostatistics is indispensable in developing pharmaceuticals and medicine because scientific questions need to be supported by quantitative research evidence. My earlier research interests in the traditional bench of life science had gradually shifted to a statistically oriented approach. Since then, my passion for biostatistics has never stopped. 

After graduated from master's school, I am currently working as a statistical consultant at the pharmacy college. With the experiences that I've participated in multiple public health projects back in the last 2 years, my current research interests lie in finding the specific cause of death and patterns by demographic factors, improving the cancer patient's quality of life by regulating survival analysis, implementing and analyzing clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of breast and pancreatic cancer.
